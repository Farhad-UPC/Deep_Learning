# Deep_Learning
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Linear_Regression ------> In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logistic Regression -------> Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable.
